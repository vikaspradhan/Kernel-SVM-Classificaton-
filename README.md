# Kernel-SVM-Classificaton-
Kernel svm is mainly used to calssify non-linear points using special maping functions called kernel tricks.
In simple terms, Kernel Tricks are functions that apply some complex mathematical operations on the lower-dimensional data points and convert them into higher dimensional space, then find out the process of separating the data points based on the labels and outputs you have defined.
There are many kernel tricks used in SVM. Some most used kernels are- the Gaussian RBF Kernel, Polynomial Kernel, Sigmoid Kernel, etc.
Here we choose the Gaussian RBF Kernel.
